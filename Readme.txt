Description of Problem: Write a program to predict housing price vs size using batch gradient descent.To implement a linear regression algorithm and use it with a real world dataset. The dataset contains a collection of real estate listings in San Luis Obispo county.

Description of Solution:LinearRegression_HousingData.m is primary project which reads file housing_price_data.dat. This program has three output graph. Initial plotting, iteration vs error and projection line graph. Screen shot of command window is also in this folder. Initial learning rate is 0.01 which takes 2000 iterations to converge. By changing learning rate we get different iterations required for convergence.
